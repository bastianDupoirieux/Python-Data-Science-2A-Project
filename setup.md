# # Setup of the python data science class project

Hey there, happy to see you found our little project. 

Have you already read the README? If not, I highly recommend you do so, otherwise, if you're interested in this project, feel free to clone it and work on it.

Our project is available under [bastianDupoirieux/Python-Data-Science-2A-Project]https://github.com/bastianDupoirieux/Python-Data-Science-2A-Project

You can clone it, and this file will work as a setup assitance, so you can start working on it as quickly as possible.

Frankly, there isn't much to be done. If you clone the repository, you will be left with a few regular .md files, and an src folder. This folder contains all the necessary data and code for the project.

The only thing to be done is unzip the data. Since it is only a single folder, you can do it by hand. Make sure you unzip it into the src file, and you're good to go :)

Also check the `requirements.md` file, to make sure you have all the technical requirements to work on the project.
